# odin-recipes
The project that I've undertaken is to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML
by designing a Recipe Website with instructions to follow such recipe using a step by step guide.
*               *               *               *               *               *           *
The Skills I would like to demonstrate would be clean well written code with comments and tabulation,
for ease of reading and understanding as though another developer had to read it.
